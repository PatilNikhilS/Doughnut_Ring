1. Header:
 A header with a logo and navigation links is a fundamental element in modern websites. It provides easy access to different sections of the website, such as the homepage, menu, reviews, and online ordering page. Including sign-up and sign-in links in the header helps businesses gather user data, personalize the experience, and maintain a loyal customer base. Anchor tags in the header allow users to jump to specific sections of the website, making navigation more efficient. Overall, a well-designed header can significantly improve the user experience, leading to higher engagement and customer satisfaction.

```
3. Carousal
 A carousel is a slideshow component that displays multiple images or 
content in a rotating cycle, allowing users to view and interact with 
various elements. The carousel typically includes navigation buttons, 
such as "prev" and "next," to enable users to manually control the 
display. Carousels are often used to showcase products, images, or 
news articles in a dynamic and engaging way.

```
4.Menu Page(Card)
A menu page is designed to display a list of items or options for users 
to select. The menu may use card elements to showcase each item, 
providing a visually appealing and organized layout. The page should 
also be designed to be responsive, meaning it can adjust and adapt to 
different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on desktop 
and mobile devices.
```
 <br><img width=1000px height=800px src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89438683/235086195-c16a98d5-a4b7-4b4b-9a8d-d19b33516b4f.png" alt="Project logo">


```
5.Review Page
The review page you have created using display flex and div‚Äôs inside div‚Äôs is a 
good design choice for displaying multiple reviews in a visually appealing and 
organized manner. Utilizing AJAX to fetch data from GitHub adds a dynamic 
component to the page, allowing users to view ratings, descriptions, and 
usernames of reviews. Additionally, the use of responsive design techniques 
can help ensure that the page displays well on all devices. Overall, the 
combination of design choices and use of AJAX to populate data makes for a 
compelling and user-friendly review page.

```
6. Order Online Page
 An online order page with card elements is an effective way to display 
products for purchase. Each card should feature a product image, name, and 
price to provide the necessary information for users to make a purchase 
decision. The page should include buttons such as "Add to Cart" and "View 
Cart" for easy navigation and purchase. Additionally, the design of the page 
should be responsive to ensure a seamless experience on all devices. Overall, 
this type of page design can provide an effective platform for e-commerce and 
online sales.

```
7. Add To Cart Page
 An "Add to Cart" page should show users the product they have added to 
their cart and allow them to adjust the quantity of each product. The page 
should feature options for users to increase or decrease the quantity of each 
product in their cart and remove products entirely if necessary. The page 
should also display a final total cost at the bottom of the page. By providing 
these options, the "Add to Cart" page can help users manage their purchases 
and ensure they are satisfied with their final selections.
